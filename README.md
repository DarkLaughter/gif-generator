## Greetings Programs

**Gif Generator is just some fun using the Giphy API.**

My aim was to create an app, that would use Axios for my HTTP requests and response management. I also wanted to build this app with just using Hooks, and implement acustom hook to simplify my components ðŸ˜…

**This app currently uses**

- React JS
- Hooks
- Axios
- Giphy Developers https://developers.giphy.com/
- CSS is custom and simple ðŸ˜‰

**User Stories:**

- Users will instantly see a random gif, and be able to generate new gifs.
- Users can also use a search function to generate a random gif linked to that keyword
- Users will also be able to see the current Rating for the Gif, in case they are interested

Available to try at [GIF Generator Demo Link](randomgif.netlify.app) ðŸ˜„
